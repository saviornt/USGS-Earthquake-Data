Q: What does this script do?<br />
A: This Python script downloads basic earthquake data from USGS and stores that data into a MongoDB database collection.
<br /><br />
Q: Does this script perform data analysis or visualization?<br />
A: This script was created to be a separate script that runs in the background and as such, it does not provide visualization or analysis on it's own.
<br /><br />
Q: Are there any future plans for this repository?<br />
A: I am planning on including a way to programmatically create a data analysis (including visualization) of earthquake data and output the analysis to a PDF document - Soon(TM).
